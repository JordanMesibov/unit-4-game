// first, the computer will have to randomly choose a target score number for the round

// then, somewhat random point values must be assigned to each of the 4 crystal images/buttons

// make it so that when the user clicks on any a crystal button, they increase their score for the round and this is displayed in the appropriate div as text




// JS CODE FOR USER WINNING THE ROUND: ---------------------

// make it so that if the user's round score is exactly equal to the target round score, they get alerted that they won the round!

// make it so that after the user gets alerted that they won a round, their win counter goes up by 1 and it gets displayed in the appropriate div.

// make it so that once the user gets their win alert and the win counter goes up by 1, and a new round starts. A new round starts when the user's round score is reset to 0, a new round target score is generated and displayed to the appropriate div, and new point values are assigned to the 4 crystal images/buttons.



// make it so that something cool happens when the user acquires their fifth win!
